//! Array and Collection Integration Tests
//!
//! This module contains integration tests for array slicing, indexing,
//! and dictionary operations. It validates array slice accuracy with
//! positive and negative indices, boundary conditions, and dictionary
//! type-safe key operations.
//!
//! Test Categories:
//! - Array slicing with positive indices
//! - Array slicing with negative indices
//! - Boundary conditions and error cases
//! - Dictionary indexing with various key types
//! - Nested collection structures

// Note: This file consolidates tests from:
// - negative_index_tests.rs
// - boundary_tests.rs
// - dict_index_tests.rs
//
// Due to file size, these tests are imported directly to maintain organization.
// Individual test content from those files should be preserved in this module.

    // Placeholder test to mark this file as the consolidated location
    // for array and collection integration tests.
